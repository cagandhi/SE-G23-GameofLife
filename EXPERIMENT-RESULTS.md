## Threats to validity
* Some of the bugs were hard to find due to less understanding of the language.To increase the validity of the testing, the tester's prior knowledge to the language should have been considered.
* As the problem statement was known to the participants and if the language was also familiar to them then it made it too easy for them to find bugs.
* There was a possibility of redundant bugs to be found in same languages as the participants were part of multiple experiments. This made them easy to find the bug.
* The difficulty of bug should not only be in the logic but also the participant's ability to debug the syntax of the code.
* The runtime of code contributed to the participant's ability to debug code faster such as "julia" took less time and "Scala" took more time to run. This parameter should be considered for the experiment.
* Also the error messages from different languages contributed to the debug time such as the error message of "julia" was irrelevant for syntax error whereas for scala it gave proper explanation and helped to debug the syntax error.
