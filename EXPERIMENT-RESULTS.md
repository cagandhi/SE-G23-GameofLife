## Threats to validity
* Some of the bugs were hard to find due to less understanding of the language.
* As the problem statement was known to the participants and if the language was also familiar to them then it made it too easy for them to find bugs.
* Possibility of redundant bugs in same languages as the participants were part of multiple experiments.
* To increase the validity of the testing, the tester's prior knowledge to the language should have been considered.
* Also the difficulty of bug is not only in the logic but also the participant's ability to debug the syntax of the code.
* Also if the runtime of code contributed to the participant's ability to debug code faster such as "julia" took less time and "Scala" took more time to run.
* Also the error messages from different languages contributed to the debug time such as the error message of julia was irrelevant for syntax error.
